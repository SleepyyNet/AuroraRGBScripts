# Scripts for Aurora unified RGB
Some scripts for Aurora unified RGB control software (https://github.com/antonpup/Aurora)

All scripts should be copied to profile folder you want to use it with (located at ``%appdata%\Aurora\Profiles``)




## Clock
Displays current time on your RGB Keyboard:
- Hours - F Keys
- Minutes - Number keys
- Seconds - NumPad keys

Red illumination means it's whole 10s, white - single 1s (ex. red 4 = 40, white 4 = 4, red and white at the same time = 44).
Colors and keys can be modified my editing the script itself.
